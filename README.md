# Graph_Theory


It is a Dijkstra Algorithm for finding shortest path from source node to target node.

Note: For input,you should first give the size of matrix,started and target node,after fill the matrix with numbers.Output will be number which is the shortest distance from start to target,if there is no path,output will be "-1".
